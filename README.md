# SpaceY_Capstone
Applied Data science project from scratch
In this project we will apply our data science skills as a Data scientist for a private space launch company.

We need to collect data, as much and relevant as possible.

We will be collecting data from various sources. After Our raw data has been collected, We will need to improve the quality by performing data wrangling. 

Then We can start exploring the processed data.

We'll gain further insights into the data by applying some basic statistical analysis and data visualization, We'll be able to see directly how variables might be related to each other.   

We will build, evaluate, and refine predictive models for discovering more exciting insights. 

The final task of this capstone project is to create a presentation that will be developed into stories of all Our analysis.
